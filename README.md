# process_flat.py
This script extracts all white rectangles from an image, allows the user to rotate them, and then saves them.  This script only works with completely flat cards (though they can be rotated.)

# process_homography.py
This script extracts a single white rectangle (card) from each input image and automatically saves it as another file.  The card must be oriented like a portrait relative to the camera, but the card does not have to be exactly alligned with the camera.

# White balancer
Quick GIMP Script-Fu script to either individually or mass-whiten files based on the value of the upper left corner.
